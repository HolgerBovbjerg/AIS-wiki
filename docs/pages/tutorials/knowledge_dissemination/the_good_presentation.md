# The good presentation
In the following tutorial, you will get some general guidelines regarding how to present.

## Who is the audience?
Rule no. 1 when presenting is to adapt the presentation to the audience. 
This might seem rather obvious, but is also very often not considered enough when preparing the presentation.
Therefore, always spend some effort to predict your audience and put yourself in their place. 

## Presentation style
Presentation style is a quite subjective matter, as the preferred presentation style will vary from person to person.
However, we can still list some general focus points:

**Presentation speed - Does your material fit the presentation speed?**
It is important that the presented material fits the amount of time a viewer will use to decode the presented information.
For instance, it can sometimes take more than 30 seconds to understand a single math equation, but it is easy to fit 5 different equations into a single slide.
In this case, we should consider whether the equations are really necessary, and if so, make time to properly explain them in a tempo that the audience can follow.

**Slides vs. Blackboard:**
These days most presentations are done using slides on a computer. 
Computer slides have the benefit that you can quickly present information in a structured manner, and allows you to present complex information in an easy way.
However, the latter part is also a downside of using slides, as you often end up presenting a lot of complex information in a short time.
The inherent limitations of the blackboard regarding presentation speed, means that you are more likely to present information in a tempo that the audience will be able to follow.
Therefore, using the blackboard for your presentation might be considered for teaching-related presentations, especially if you have difficulties managing your presentation speed. 
However, using the blackboard during lectures requires good handwriting and drawing skills.
A hybrid approach can also be used, where you present some theory, with some initial simple examples on the blackboard, and later want to show more complex examples on slides.

**Audience interaction:**
During your presentation you can interact with the audience in many ways.
The most straight forward way is to pose them a question, and hope somebody answers. 
However, this only works if the audience is actively engaged, and might occasionally be met with silence, especially Monday morning.
Another technique is to use props either physical or on the computer.
One example could be to use the microphone in your computer and show of some speech processing algorithm in real time, perhaps even letting an audience member try it out.
However, this requires some preparations, as you have to be sure that the demonstration does not fail.
