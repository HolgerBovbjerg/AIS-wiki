# General design guidelines
When presenting your work to other people, there are many design choices to make.
One of the choices you have to make, is what colours to use and what font to use.
This guide serves the purpose of helping you make these choices.
By adopting a common design langauge, following the guidelines of the University, will create a strong visual identity that is recognisable.
Additionally, you will likely improve your own end-product, and end up with a nicer looking presentation/poster/paper/etc.

## Fonts
Regarding fonts, the first rule is to be consistent. 
Keep the number of different fonts to a minimum, ideally max. 2. Also, keep the number of different font sizes in your material to a minimum.
E.g., if you make a figure for a paper, try to use the same font sizes as the paper, or at least have consistent font sizes throughout your figure.

Regarding the choice of font, the official font of the University is called Barlow.
It can be freely downloaded from our [github repository templates](https://github.com/HolgerBovbjerg/AIS-wiki/tree/main/templates/) folder or from [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow).
Alternatively, if you cannot use Barlow, Arial is the preferred font and is available on most systems.
Both Barlow and Arial are sans-serif fonts, which means they don't have *feet*, in contrast to *serif* font like *Times New Roman*.

When writing articles, the conference venue/journal generally dictates a specific font to use for the body text. 
This font will generally be a serif font as this helps readability when printing the text on paper.
However, when creating figures and plots, it is generally better to use a sans-serif font, thus if the conference or journal does not specify otherwise you should use Barlow or Arial (or other sans-serif fonts).

When making posters and presentation slides, it generally recommended to only use sans-serif fonts.
The following links contains some discussions of when to use serif vs. sans-serif:

## Colours
AAU has 3 primary colours and 9 secondary colours. The main colour is called AAU Blue and is a dark/navy blue colour as seen in the AAU logo and many other places.
The main colours should be the most prominent in your material, while the secondary colours can be used to add detail and variation, e.g., differentiating plots in figures.
An example of all the official colours:

Generally it is recommended to use the official colours for things like graphs figures and other design elements.
However, in many cases you need to make sure that we use colours that are appropriate for what you are trying to present.
For instance, it is important to ensure that your plots won't be misinterpreted be someone who is colourblind (maybe even unknowingly).
One example of a tool to find good colours for plots and figures is [Colorbrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/).
