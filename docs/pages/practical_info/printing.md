# General printing
AAU has printers scattered around the campus which can be with an employee or student card.
These printers use a follow-you server such that you print jobs are accessible on all of them, meaning you can simply print to "follow-you".
For more information you can read about printing and copying at the designated [AAU print and copy website](https://www.en.its.aau.dk/instructions/printcopy).

# Poster printing
When you need to print a poster for a conference there are two options:

1. Get the poster plotted locally
2. Get it professionally printed

## Professional poster printing
If you want a very high quality poster or a fabric poster (easier to travel with), 
you have to contact Novagraf A/S at [kontakt@novagraf.dk](mailto:kontakt@novagraf.dk).

If you want to use this service, please ensure your poster is finalized and sent **well in advance** of your deadline (1-2 weeks before) to allow time for printing, especially for print on fabric.

## Local poster printing
This option is great if you are in a hurry, as the print time is much faster than the professional service.

To print a poster, simply send your **PDF file** to [komponenten@es.aau.dk](mailto:komponenten@es.aau.dk). 
The staff will handle the printing for you.

### What size should I choose: A0 or A0+?

The printer uses paper that is **914 mm wide**, which is slightly wider than standard A0. You can choose between the following options:

- **A0**  
  Printed at standard A0 size, resulting in white margins of approximately **30 mm on each side**.  
  - You can leave the margins or trim them off after printing.

- **A0+**  
  The poster is scaled to fit the **full 914 mm width**, resulting in a final size of **914 Ã— 1292 mm**.
